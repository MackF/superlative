        Home. Nothing important goes here. For now, it will be the project
        staus. Right now, for feature 3, the database is hooked up and the
        routing is configured. The create forms is functioning, needs
        authentification to put it in its final form. But for now, the user just
        enters their name for the form, and it is submitted. Routing works, and
        the vote feature currently can direct to the right form.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        ### TODO ### for feature 4 to make that paragraph true: - build create
        form - get routing to work to be able to display a voting form.
